In java, everything should be written in class only and main method. Whatever data given to java , it will be in the form of strings and it will store in array.


in scanner class , we have multiple pre-defined methods. Thus creating an object for scanner class , u can access those pre-defined methods.


import java.util.Scanner;
class person{
    scanner
}
Class Main{
   public static void Main(String args[]){
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(system.in);
        int a = sc.nextInt();
        System.out.println("a");
  }
}

NWEEEEE

import java.util.Scanner;
class person{
    void call(){
         Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = sc.nextInt();
        System.out.println("a");
    }
}
class Main{
   public static void Main(String args[]){
       person obj = new person();
       obj.call();
  }
}


"creat a class using class keyword and name of the class, starting of the class should be capital and no bracket"
"all the methods name of the method should be small"
