*Static block and cunstructor*

cunstructers are used to inisialize our objects, for every clASS there will be defoult constructor whenever create an object constructor will be callde that object will be created
constructor having class name are method properties

EXAM:-
public class q2 {
    public static void main(String[ args]){
        Demo d1 = new Demo();
        Demo d2 = new Demo();1
    }
}
class Demo {
    static {
        System.out.println("Static block");
        Demo(); {
            system.out.println("Constructor");
        }
    }


Static block will be created with the static keyword it will called autometically no need to call it either object or class 

static method:- 
for static method no need to call with objects you can directly call with class name and here static will act as instance or object

conditional statement
Types 
If â€“ else, else - if ladder, switch case
Conditional statements are used to check the condition and to print the relevant block in constant time 
if  (statement)
     {
       return truee or else return false  
     }
 else 
     {
   if gives false then we use this else part 
     }
 
 control statements:
   entry control loop 
      for and while loop 
 eg of for: 
  for(start;end; diff)
 eg for start:
   start;
   while(end){
      diff;
   }
 when we know the range we will use for loop and when we dont know the range we prefer to use while loop
   exit control loop
