Array : 
  Array is collection of similar kind of data that continuous allocation . In c/C++, we have pointers that defentily elements will be stored in continous format.  In java, we dont have pointers. There is a chance of 
elements stored in random places.
Syntax:
   datatype[] = arr(name) 

Primitive and non primitive 
Primitive datatypes cant be splited or divided. Non primitive data types can be divided. 

Primitive:Eg: int , float, char,
Non primitive: eg: string , and all tge objects that were created by th users. (class node = int data , node next)

All the objects will be stored in int memory. all the refernces will be stored in stack memories. Stack memory having less space comapre to int memory.
All the variables are stored in same datatype. Instead of creating multiple variables create an array to store those values.
If we create multiple variables to get the data , simply we can print the data . If it comes to array we want to print the data we can print using index values. and by default index value will start from 0 . 
Delcaration and initialization happened in same line.

To get the length of the arraywe have a method called arr.length and 
in string , it is string_name.length().

Camel case : arrayName.length
snake case : arr.length

In java , it is pereferred to use camel case to write production level code .Production level code in wriiten in standard case. 

Prolduction level :
eg: void additionofTwoNumbers(){
            
        }

Tpye of printing format:

we can print the array values usning simple for loop
for(i=0;i<arr.length;i++);{
        System.out.println(arr[0]);
        }  

we can print array values using for-each loop.
 for(int i:arr){
            System.out.println(i + ""));
        }

In for-each loop, we dont need index values. 

toString is an inbuilt method to print array . So it will accept one arguement and that too array.

Declaring the size of an array and initializing  the values later .
Array having fixed size . If we once  delcare an array size it cant be changed. 
 before = array refrence is created with the help of new keyword actual object will be created in the int memory .for the particular datatype and size 
If the array type is int, all the default values are 0 .If it is a string , al the default value is null.  and null is a literal .

Whenever we are trying to assign or trying to get nth value of array you will get exception called arrays

public class MaxValue {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {2,27,11,99,34};

        int j = arr[0]; 

        for (int i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
            if (arr[i] > j) {
                j = arr[i];
            }
        }

        System.out.println("The Second highest value in the array is: " + j);
    }
}
